# Crime-Pulse-In-UK
Power BI Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard visualizing crime statistics across the 32 London boroughs under the **Metropolitan Police Service (MPS)**, excluding the **City of London Police** jurisdiction. The data, sourced from **UK MPS Monthly Crime Datasets (2019â€“2021)**, is categorized by crime type, financial year, borough, and Basic Command Unit (BCU).

Key metrics and insights were extracted using **T-SQL procedures** for building tables, views, and stored procedures. The process involved importing data into **SQL Server**, connecting with **Power BI**, and performing **data cleaning**, **transformation**, and **relationship building**. The final dashboard features maps, line charts, bar charts, KPIs, and donut charts, offering a clear, visual narrative of crime trends within the Metropolitan Police area.
